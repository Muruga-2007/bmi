You are the world’s best UI/UX designer + creative developer + motion designer.
Build a premium cinematic website footer and adjacent cinematic animations for A-Zentrix.

COMPANY (use this in copy, tone and microcopy):
A-Zentrix is a technology company based in India specializing in AI, Machine Learning, and advanced tech solutions that help businesses boost efficiency and competitiveness.

CORE SERVICES (use for helpful microcopy / link labels / mini highlights):
- AI-Powered Analytics: Real-time insights, predictive models, trend forecasts.
- Custom Software Development: Tailored apps and enterprise tools.
- Machine Learning: Automation, accuracy, customer insights.
- Cloud Solutions: Migration, management, security, scalability.
- Cybersecurity: Assessments, threat detection, response.

GOAL:
- Create a trendy, luxury, cinematic footer and surrounding motion design for A-Zentrix’s website.
- Must feel premium (Apple × Netflix × top AI brand) and sell trust to B2B clients.
- The website should be great and very good with all due animation — polished, performant, and tasteful.

STYLE & UX:
- Dark mode default with optional light variant.
- Glassmorphism + subtle gradients + soft glow edges.
- Ambient background: slow-moving gradient + particles or soft noise texture.
- Micro-interactions: hover glow, underline sweep, focus rings, small 3D tilt.
- Strong UX: clear navigation, fast access to core services, visible CTA for lead capture.

FOOTER CONTENT & LAYOUT:
- Top bar: short headline (e.g. “Let’s build intelligent systems together”) + small CTA.
- Main grid:
  LEFT: Brand logo + concise tagline reflecting A-Zentrix (India + AI expertise).
  MIDDLE: Quick links — Product, Services (use core services short names), Pricing, Docs, Careers.
  RIGHT: Newsletter/signup or Request Demo form (email + select service dropdown).
- Bottom row: Social icons, live status indicator (optional), legal links (Terms, Privacy), © line with year and company name.

ANIMATIONS (required):
- Scroll reveal: subtle fade + blur → crisp, with staggered children.
- Floating soft-glow horizon line at top of footer.
- CTA cinematic hover: scale + glow + shimmer sweep.
- Staggered link entrance and hover underline sweep.
- Subtle parallax on background elements and gentle particle movement.
- Accessible motion settings: respect prefers-reduced-motion.

TECH & DELIVERABLES:
- React + TypeScript (.tsx)
- TailwindCSS for tokens and utility styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- One production-ready Footer.tsx component (responsive, accessible)
- One small helper/config object (design tokens & animation timing)
- Comments, ARIA, keyboard focus states, and responsive breakpoints
- Keep code performant and not heavy — lazy-load heavy visuals if needed

COPY TONE & MICROCOPY:
- Confident, B2B-friendly, concise: emphasize expertise, outcomes, and trust.
- Example tagline options: “AI that accelerates growth”, “Predict. Automate. Scale.”
- CTA options: “Request Demo”, “Talk to Sales”, “Get Early Access”

PERFORMANCE & ACCESSIBILITY:
- No large blocking scripts in footer
- Images/SVG optimized; use system fonts fallback
- Provide prefers-reduced-motion fallbacks
